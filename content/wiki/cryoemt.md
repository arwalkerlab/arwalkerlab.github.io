#Cryo-EM#

Very large multi-domain structures are often resolved using cryo-EM. This experimental technique is quite powerful and advancing rapidly, but often has structures that are low-resolution and sometimes hard to simulate.

These issues can be addressed to some degree by overlaying high resolution crystal subdomains onto the main cryo-EM structure.
