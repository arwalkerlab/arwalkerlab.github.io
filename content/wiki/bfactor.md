#Debye-Waller factors#

These are often referred to as B factors or the temperature factor. This is a scattering parameter that comes from thermal vibrational motion--in general, the more flexible the residue, the more smeared out the electornic density, and the higher the B factor. 

These can be found in a PDB in the 11th column, prior to the element column. 

These values can be compared to root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), root mean square deviation (RMSD), and normal mode vibrations to connect between theory and experiment.
