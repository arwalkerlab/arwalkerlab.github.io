We are not currently hiring for postdoctoral positions and are full on undergraduate research positions, but watch this space! Applicants interested in pursuing external support are welcome. PhD students interested in research opportunities are also very welcome.  

If you'd like to work on excited state simulations of biomolecules, relevant method development, and or the development of new machine learning models, please contact arwalker[at]wayne[dot]edu for further information.
