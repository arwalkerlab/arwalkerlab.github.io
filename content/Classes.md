# Classes

I plan to teach a course on photochemistry in biology! Here is a set of topics:

- Basics of photochemistry and excited state theory

- Photosynthesis and photoenzymes

- Fluorescent proteins/bioluminescence 

- Isomerizing channel proteins and optics

- Simulations of excited state systems



The goal of this course is that everyone will have some new understanding of photochemistry in biology, and how experimental and theoretical chemistry can work together to investigate these systems.
